Loading ggplot2, dplyr package and data set.  Manipulating data to make it workable
====================================================================================

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
activity <- read.csv("./activity.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
head(activity)
names(activity)
str(activity)
###Convert date format to date
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
activity <- mutate(activity, weekday=weekdays(date))
head(activity)
names(activity)
str(activity)
summary(activity)
```

Steps Histogram and mean total number of steps taken per day?
===============================================================

```{r, echo=TRUE}
TotalStepsDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, FUN = sum, na.rm=TRUE)
head(TotalStepsDay)
##qplot(steps, data = TotalStepsDay, bins=15)
TotalStepsPlot <- ggplot(TotalStepsDay, aes(steps))
TotalStepsPlot + geom_histogram(bins=15, fill="red")
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
