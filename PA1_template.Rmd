## Loading ggplot2, dplyr package and data set.  Manipulating data to make it workable

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
activity <- read.csv("./activity.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
head(activity)
names(activity)
str(activity)
###Convert date format to date
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
activity <- mutate(activity, weekday=weekdays(date))
head(activity)
names(activity)
str(activity)
summary(activity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
